>This project merges two worlds, the **pictorial** and the **videogame** one. The starting pictorial work is ***Broadway Boogie Woogie*** (1942-43) by **Piet Mondrian**, a painting in which the author expresses the fascination and **emotions** he felt towards the jazz music he encountered in New York.

> Observing the work, the connection with the arcade video games of the **80s** was immediate, so we tried to merge the vintage video game world with the **feelings** of the author and the idea of ​​what New York was for those who ventured there to **find fortune.**
